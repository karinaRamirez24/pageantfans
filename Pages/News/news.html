                            Thom Brodeur: Brand Builder. Market Disruptor. Mr. Congeniality. Brodeur’s final word to our editor was “there is an old saying: ‘behind every great man, there has to be a great woman.’ Personally? I’d like to flip that on its head. I want to be the great man, behind every great woman who chooses to participate in this industry. Going back to basics, remembering what and most importantly ‘who’ is the center of these industries, and innovating and challenging the status quo is how we’ll get there. Watch this space for big things. They’re coming.” <a href="https://celebritylosangeles.com/fashion/thom-brodeur-visionary-ceo-and-champion-of-women-in-the-beauty-industry/" target="_blank"><button class="button-1">Read More</button></a>
